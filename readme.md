## Benjamin Moore Paint Colours as CSS Variables

Ever want to make your website Benjamin Moore's Chantilly lace?

Now you can:

```css
body {
  background: var(--chantilly-lace);
}
```

There are about 4,100 colours so you probably don't want to load the entire `all.css` file into your project (40k gzipped, that is kinda big!).

Visit [bm.wesbos.com](https://bm.wesbos.com) and copy + paste them as you need them.


## Legal

The colour names are owned Benjamin Moore. Hopefully they don't DMCA me.

Benjamin, (can I call you ben?) if you are reading this, I'm happy to take it down if you don't want it up. We just love your colours.
